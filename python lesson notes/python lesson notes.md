*A Python program is executed from the Python interpreter.* 

So let’s get started with Python on this Replit IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) by writing a simple program that displays the messages **“Welcome to Python on Replit”** and **“This is where things start to get very interesting, Python is fun”** and **“There is so much that can be done with it”** on the console. The word *console* is an old computer term that refers to the text entry and display device of a computer. Console input means to receive input from the keyboard and console output means to display output to the monitor. 

The symbol >>> or ![](Aspose.Words.2582c453-c17c-48a1-93f6-52ec52e64e72.001.png) (the command-line interface with the blinking cursor) is the Python statement prompt, and it is where you can enter a Python statement. 

So, what is a statement. A statement is simply a section of code that represents a command or action. Each statement specifies a task to perform. For example: 

![](Aspose.Words.2582c453-c17c-48a1-93f6-52ec52e64e72.002.png)

In the code snippet shown above, line 1 is called a variable assignment statement, because it assigns the value of “tobi” to a variable called name. Line 2 is a function call statement, it calls the print function and displays an output on the console. We will discuss more about all these concepts as we explore further. 

Please type the following commands exactly as they are written in this text. 

In the console window, right at the prompt with the blinking cursor, type print(“Welcome to Python on Replit”) and press the Enter key. The string Welcome to Python on Replit should appear on the console. String is a programming term meaning a sequence of zero or more characters, you probably know this already but there is nothing wrong in emphasizing it. 

Next, at the console input area, type print(“This is where things start to get very interesting, Python is fun”) and press Enter. Lastly type print(“There is so much that can be done with it”) and also press Enter. 

*Note* 

*Note that Python requires double or single quotation marks around strings to mark them out from other code. As you can see in the output, Python doesn’t display those quotation marks.* 

The print statement is one of Python’s built-in functions that can be used to display a string on the console. A function performs actions. In the case of the print function, it displays a message to the console. 

*Note* 

*In programming terminology, when you use a function, you are said to be “invoking a function” or “calling a function.”* 

You can add additional statements at the statement prompt >>>. For instance, typing 30 + 6 should output 36. 

**Creating Python Source Code Files** 

Entering Python statements at the statement prompt >>> is convenient, but the statements are not saved. To save statements for later use, you can create a text file to store the statements. 

A text file named main.py is already available for you by default. By convention, Python files are named with the extension .py 

This main.py file is called the source file or script file, or module. Running a Python program from a script file is known as running Python in *script mode*. Typing a statement at the statement prompt >> and executing it is called running Python in *interactive mode*. 

Now, type the three print statements you earlier typed in the interactive mode at the statement prompt in the main.py file to run your program in script mode. Hit the Run button above to see the output at the console. Once again, note that the print statement is one of Python’s built-in functions that can be used to display a string on the console. Another built-in function is type(), which returns the data type of the variable that the function has been provided. For example, type type(4) at the statement prompt and you should see number displayed on the console. Now, type(“coding”) also and you should see string displayed on the console. 

Additionally, note that Python programs are case sensitive. It would be wrong, for example, to replace print in the program with Print. Try it and see what happens. 

You have seen several special characters (#, ", ()) in the program. They are used in almost every program. The table below summarizes their uses: 

**Performing Mathematical Computations with Python** 

Python programs can perform all sorts of mathematical computations and display the result, from addition to subtraction, multiplication and division. 

To show an example of a program that evaluates ![](Aspose.Words.2582c453-c17c-48a1-93f6-52ec52e64e72.003.png)and prints its result. Type print((10.5 + 2 \* 3) / (45 – 3.5)) in your main.py file and run it. 

As you can see, it is a straightforward process to translate an arithmetic expression to a Python expression. We will discuss Python expressions further as we proceed and perform more complex mathematical operations, but for now, this is just an intro. [insert smiley face here] 

Do the following 

Task 1. Write a program that displays the result of ![](Aspose.Words.2582c453-c17c-48a1-93f6-52ec52e64e72.004.png)

Task 2. Write a program that displays the area and perimeter of a rectangle with the width of 4.5 and height of 7.9 using the following formula: *area = width \* height* 

Task 3. Assume a runner runs 16 kilometers in 45 minutes and 30 seconds. Write a program that displays the average speed in miles per hour. (Note that 1 mile is 1.6 kilometers.) 

Task 4. Assume that a runner runs 24 miles in 1 hour, 40 minutes, and 35 seconds. Write a program that displays the average speed in kilometers per hour. (Note 1 mile is equal to 1.6 kilometers.)
